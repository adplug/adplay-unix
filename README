AdPlay/UNIX - UNIX console-based OPL2 audio player
Copyright (C) 2001 - 2017 Simon Peter <dn.tlp@gmx.net>

Description
-----------
AdPlay/UNIX is AdPlug's UNIX console-based frontend. AdPlug is a free,
universal OPL2 audio playback library. AdPlay/UNIX supports the full range
of AdPlug's file format playback features. Despite this, at the moment, only
emulated OPL2 output is supported by AdPlay/UNIX, but this on a wide range
of output devices.

Prerequisites
-------------
The following libraries are needed in order to compile this program:

Library		Version
-------		-------
AdPlug		>= 1.4, or >= 2.2 for full feature support

git
---
If you checked out from git, first run:

autoreconf --install

to generate the build cruft and get the configure script. You need recent
versions of autoconf, automake and libtool to do this. If autoreconf fails
for any reason or you are hacking on the build system, you can run each step
manually instead of using autoreconf:

libtoolize -c -f --install
aclocal -Im4 -Im4/gnulib
autoheader
automake -a -c
autoconf

Usage
-----
Start AdPlay/UNIX with at least one file to be played as parameter.
Additional commandline parameters are explained by typing:

adplay --help

Or by reading the man page. A more detailed doc will follow when i get the
time to write one. Any help is greatly appreciated!
